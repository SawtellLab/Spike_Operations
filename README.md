# Spike_Operations
Scripts run in Spike that perform non-analytical functions. Software operations oriented, not data oriented. 

A short description of all scripts in this folder. Please add descriptions as you add scripts here. Indicate author. 

Closecareful.s2s   (AE)
    Close all open windows. Prompt to save time views, no prompt for all others (xy & results)
    Safer than the close-all script we have floating around that doesn’t save time views.
	
startupMakeDateDir.s2s   (AE)
   Creates a directory named today’s date when you start Spike 

smartWFimport.s2s    (AE)
   Import waveforms. Calculates waveform length for you.

Optimisecontinuously.s2s  (AE)
    Choose a channel and continuously optimise it. Useful for receptive field mapping where you rapidly use stimuli ranging several orders of magnitude.

Repeater.s2s   (AE)
   Replay a sequence of events or key presses.

markerPSTH.s2s   (AE)
   Make multiple psths, filtering data based on multiple markers.
